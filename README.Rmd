The goal of the ghqc ecosystem is to simplify, standardize, and improve traceability of the QC process through the use of shiny apps which create GitHub Issues and Milestones for your project. ghqc.app is intended to be used with the [ghqc](https://github.com/a2-ai/ghqc) package, which will aid in the setup and launching of the shiny apps. The ghqc.app package has 3 main applications/functions:

1. GHQC_ASSIGN_APP: This app will help you to assign a set of files, checklists, and reviewers to a GitHub Milestone to kick-off the QC process.

2. GHQC_RESOLVE_APP: After each cycle of QC review, this app will help you to communicate your resolution of a comment to the reviewer through file differences

3. GHQC_RECORD_APP: At the end of the QC review, this app will help you to create a record, in the form of a pdf, to be saved to show the results of the QC review
